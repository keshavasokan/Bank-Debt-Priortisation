# Bank Debt Priortisation

After a debt has been legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank, the account is considered to be "charged-off." 
However, banks  do not simply walk away from the debt and usually would still want to collect some of the money they are owed. 
In this project, I look at a situation where a bank assigned delinquent customers to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believed it would recover from the customer.
